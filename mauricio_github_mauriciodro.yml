        at the beginning of each launch and sprint. The product owner must continually remind the team 
        of the Sprint and Release goals. This helps keep the team on track and serves as a general 
        yardstick for the team to measure its activity and progress. Represents the client, interacts 
        and engages the client. Be prepared to lead the team in a different direction at the end of 
        each Sprint, if necessary. To participate in Daily Scrums, Sprint Planning Meetings, and 
        Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives. Inspect the progress of the product at the end of each Sprint 
        and accept or reject the work done. Work that is not complete or not done should be prioritized 
        or sequenced. Communicate the state externally.
